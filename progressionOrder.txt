Routes
 - Make sure that every redirect, render, and post is connected to the proper route. (redirect is connected to routes, render is connected to views)
 - Make sure it follows the proper middleware and error handling order (see classifcation for example)

Controllers
 - Make sure controllers are exported and have the correct names that are being used in the routes.
 - Make sure all needed files are imported from the correct models, utilities
 
 - Stop if you see that you a controller uses a model or function found in another file to go look at that file

Models 
 - Check classifcation model for example

Validation/Utilties
 - Check classification rules and classification data functions for example.
   Pass all form items inplace of classification_name
